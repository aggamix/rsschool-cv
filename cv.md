### About me:
In my little career experience I have managed to acquire good qualities. I am stress resilient, pressure resistant and good at multitasking. I always have a plan that I work on to maximize my day. I also have the quality:  Management of the team, responsible for others, training of the employees, respectful attitude to all, attentive, calm and of course I have a good sense of humor. All this experience I got for 3 years of work in different areas. For about a year, I’ve been studying frontend development. Now I’m taking a course where I’m consolidating and improving my knowledge to get a job and move forward in the technology world. This has almost become my job because I write code every day. I practice my knowledge in solving new problems. I always try to solve the problems I face in learning and in life.
